## 1. Introduction
The main aim of this project is to create a network that can classify Alzheimers disease by distinguishing between patients and those, with AD. To accomplish this we will use the ADNI brain dataset. Target an accuracy level of 0.8.

Siamese Networks are a type of network architecture designed for tasks involving image comparison and similarity verification. In this architecture there are two subnetworks called "subnetworks each processing its own input and generating a feature vector as output. These feature vectors are. Merged for further analysis or comparison purposes.

ResNet-18, a renowned convolutional neural network architecture, is employed in this project to extract features from two input images. It consists of multiple convolutional layers and residual blocks, enabling effective feature extraction.

The input images undergo these convolutional layers to capture increasingly complex features. This depth is valuable for intricate pattern recognition.

After extracting features from both images, the project calculates the feature distance to classify them. ResNet-18's depth and feature extraction capabilities aid in accurate classification.

## 5. Siamese Network
Siamese Networks operate using a structured framework, as depicted in the diagram:
![Alt text](Images_Report/Siamese.png)

1.	**Input Phase:** Two distinct inputs are processed through identical subnetworks, which share the same parameters and weights.
2.	**Feature Extraction:** Each subnetwork extracts relevant features from its respective input.
3.	**Distance Measurement:** A distance function, like Euclidean distance or cosine similarity, is applied to compare the extracted features.
4.	**Outcome:** The network produces a similarity score indicating the likeness between the two input items.

Siamese Networks find utility in diverse applications, including:
**Applications:**
- Face Verification: Discerning whether two facial images belong to the same person.
- Image Retrieval: Locating the most analogous image in a database to a given one.
- Signature Verification: Confirming whether two signatures originate from the same individual.
- Document Analysis: For determining the similarity of textual documents or handwriting samples.
- Recommendation Systems: For suggesting items or content similar to a user's preferences.
- Medical Image Analysis: Such as identifying similar medical scans or pathology slides.
- Speaker Verification: Confirming if two voice samples belong to the same speaker.
- Gesture Recognition: In human-computer interaction to identify similar hand or body gestures.

**Advantages:**
- Parameter Sharing: Shared parameters between subnetworks reduce the total model parameters.
- Training Efficiency: The parameter-sharing design facilitates faster convergence.
- Versatility: They can be adapted for one-to-one comparisons and readily expanded for one-to-many or many-to-many comparisons.
- Small Data Support: Effective for tasks with limited data, such as signature verification.

**Disadvantages:**
- Data Imbalance: Acquiring suitable positive and negative samples can pose challenges in specific use cases.
- Complex Configuration: Setting up the network and defining the contrastive loss function can be intricate.
- Resource Intensive: Training deep Siamese Networks may require substantial computational resources.
- Limited Pre-trained Models: Availability of pre-trained models may be limited for certain domains.

In this project, the Siamese structure employs the ResNet-18, a deep convolutional neural network consisting of 18 layers. ResNet-18 serves as the subnetwork, responsible for feature extraction from the input images. It's worth mentioning that my colleague and I consistently utilized the ResNet-18 model for enhancing the feature extraction process during our collaboration.

## 6. Resnet18 Architecture
![Alt text](Images_Report/Resnet18.png)

Resnet18 Architecture serves as the backbone of this project, playing a vital role in processing and analyzing the images effectively. It belongs to the Residual Network (ResNet) family, which is renowned for its competence in training deep neural networks. The architecture is particularly well-suited for intricate image-related tasks, making it a suitable choice for the complexity of classifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal control (NC) brain images.

Within this architecture, Resnet18 undertakes the task of handling two input images, diligently extracting crucial features from each. Its deep structure, composed of 18 layers, empowers the network to discern intricate details within the images. The deep layers are instrumental in recognizing patterns, textures, and other visual attributes essential for distinguishing between AD and NC brain images.

## 7. Dataset

- The dataset employed in this project originates from the publicly available ADNI brain dataset, which can be conveniently acquired by accessing ADNI. This dataset encompasses a grand total of 4,424 brain MRI scans, where 2,315 scans are associated with AD patients, and the remaining 2,109 scans correspond to NC individuals.

NC Image

- To ensure consistency and facilitate the subsequent processing and analysis, the dataset underwent a preprocessing phase. This entailed standardizing all images to a uniform 256x240 pixel resolution and converting them to grayscale. Furthermore, a systematic naming convention was enforced, where all filenames adhere to the "1182968_94.jpeg" format. 

- The initial segment of each filename serves as a distinct patient identifier, while the subsequent part designates the image's unique ID. Each patient has contributed a comprehensive set of 12 brain MRI scans to enrich the dataset.

The presented module encapsulates the core elements of our project description, meticulously conveying the salient details for incorporation into our project report.

## 8. Model Training
- The training procedure involves a two-phase approach, each pivotal in shaping the model's proficiency.

- In the first phase, we employ a pre-trained Resnet18 architecture. This pre-trained model serves as a potent feature extractor, significantly expediting the extraction of salient features from the input data. We've meticulously fine-tuned the Resnet18 model to make it harmonious with our specific task, ensuring that it excels at feature extraction.

- After the pre-training phase, we seamlessly transition to the second stage. Here, the Siamese network is the star, trained using our pre-processed dataset. The Siamese network's architecture is meticulously designed to compare and classify AD and NC images based on the feature vectors it extracts.

- For the training phase, we adopt the Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (BCELoss), a well-established function in binary classification tasks. This loss function is mathematically defined as BCELoss(x, y) = -y * log(x) - (1 - y) * log(1 - x), where "x" represents the model's prediction, and "y" is the true label.

- To guide the training process, we enlist the Adam optimizer with a modest learning rate of 0.001. This learning rate strikes a delicate balance between efficient training and the potential risk of overfitting.

- The training outcomes for the 50 epochs are thoughtfully documented and complemented by informative visual representations. Two significant graphical representations are pivotal in understanding the model's training journey:


**1.	Training Accuracy:**

The Training Accuracy chart vividly showcases the convergence of the model's training process. Over the course of 1,200 training steps, we observe substantial improvements in accuracy.

## 9. Model Testing

- The testing phase mirrors the training phase in many aspects, albeit with a different goal: assessing performance. This phase is dedicated to evaluating the Siamese network's ability to generalize to unseen data.

- The testing results for both the 50-epoch model and the truncated 10-epoch model are diligently presented. These results offer valuable insights into the model's performance on the test dataset.

**Testing Results (50 Epochs):** 

Additionally, we provide a concise evaluation of the model trained for only 10 epochs, albeit without the detailed log data:

1.	10 Epochs – Accuracy =83%
2.	25 Epochs – Accuracy = 85%
3.	50 Epochs – Accuracy = 82%


## 11. Future Improvements 

In the realm of future work, several avenues present themselves. It's essential to explore network structure optimization to enhance model performance further. Additionally, efforts can be directed towards minimizing training costs, which can make the model more accessible and practical. Furthermore, investigating more efficient data loading techniques can streamline the workflow, potentially leading to improved efficiency. These potential directions pave the way for further advancements in this project.
