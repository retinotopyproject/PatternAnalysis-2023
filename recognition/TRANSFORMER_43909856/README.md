### Notes


Datasets:
- MRI data (NIFTI image - .nii files) - can use ITK Snap (for prostate data only) or SMILI to visualise

ADNI data:
- Includes image level labels (Alzheimer's or normal brain)
- JPEG images
- Similar to OASIS dataset
- 10k-20k samples

Avoid pre-trained models, but weights of models can be pre-loaded.
